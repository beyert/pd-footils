shabby~	- waveshaping PD external, probably running on Max as well

* Who is shabby~?

shabby~ is a waveshaper using 11 Chebyshev polynoms to generate harmonics from an
incoming sinewave. Each polynom will have a signal
inlet to specify its amplitude in the signal. You can use shabby~ to have a
decent additive synth that allows control over the harmonics in the course
of a note at signal rate. But beware: it's not very fast.

shabby~ was written by Frank Barknecht <barknech@ph-cip.uni-koeln.de> after
finally getting his copy of Dodge/Jerse's "Computer Music" ;)

shabby~ uses the flext C++ layer for Max/MSP and pd (pure data) externals available at 
http://www.parasitaere-kapazitaeten.net/Pd/ext/

You need at least flext version 0.2.0. The included binary for linux was compiled
using g++-3.0. If you don't have g++ 3.0 installed, you will have to edit the
makefile, where I selected g++ 3.0.

* Who is shaffy~?

shaffy~ is shabby~'s little brother. He uses float inlets to scale the
amplitudes of only 9 polynom harmonics because of Max compatibility.  This
makes it a lot faster than shabby~, but you can only update the polynome
factors at message rate, that might be to slow for some applications. 

You need at least flext version 0.2.2 for shaffy~ because it includes a needed
workaround for g++.
