_ _____SyncGrain implements synchronous granular synthesis.

The source sound for the grains is obtained by reading a function table
containing the samples of the source waveform. The grain generator has full
control of frequency (grains/sec), overall amplitude, grain pitch (a sampling
increment) and grain size (in millisecs). An extra parameter is the grain
pointer speed (or rate), which controls which position the generator will start
reading samples in the table for each successive grain. It is measured in
fractions of grain size, so a value of 1 will make each successive grain read
from where the previous grain should finish. A value of 0.5 will make the next
grain start at the midway position from the previous grain start and finish,
etc. A value of 0 will make the generator read always from the start of the
table.  This control gives extra flexibility for creating timescale
modifications in the resynthesis.

_ ___help __ _
1. inlet: "set arrayname" message to choose grain source array/table. 
!!! DON'T EVER DELETE THE TABLE AFTERWARDS !!!
2. inlet: Grain Frequency in grains per second
3. inlet: Amplitude, default starting value is 1
4. inlet: Pitch of the grains
5. inlet: GrainSize in milli-seconds! Good values are between 10 and 50 msec.
6. inlet: PointerRate. Normally 0-1, but have fun with greater or smaller values!

_ ____Requirements__ _
A binary for Linux is included. To run it, you need the SndObject-Library by 
Dr Victor Lazzarini. syncgrain~ is a direct port of the SndObject SyncGrain in
this library. You can download SndObj for Linux, W32 and IRIX at: 
http://www.may.ie/academic/music/musictec/SndObj/main.html

To build syncgrain~ you also need flext by Thomas Grill in version 0.4.1,

_ ____Bugs__ _
_ probably some...

_ ____License__ _

_ ____Authors__ _
This pd external was written by me, Frank Barknecht <fbar@footils.org> Thanks
go out to Victor Lazzarini for writing SndObj and for his great help and
patience with my questions, and the same applies to flext-author Thomas Grill.
