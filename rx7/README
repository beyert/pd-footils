USAGE
-----

If you start "pd help-rx7~.pd" in this directory, the rx7~ object should be
created. Don't bother if [dsp] has no patch cords, it's part of IEMLIB and the
help-patch works anyway.

To install the external systemwide, copy rx7~.pd_linux to your favourite
external path, for example /usr/lib/pd/externs/ - and copy help-rx7~.pd into
the refernence  directory of the PD distribution, e.g.
/usr/lib/pd/doc/5.reference/

rx7~ needs to load a bank file, before operation. Just send it a message "load
/path/to/bank.bnk".

After that you can select which bank to use with programm change messages:
"prog bank channel".
Example: "prog 28 2" loads programm 28 into channel 2

Play note with note-messages. Syntax: "note midinote velocity channel". 
Example: "note 60 64 1" plays a C (midi number "60") with velocity "64" on
channel 1



HOWTO compile rx7~.pd_linux?
----------------------------

First download rx-saturno-0.0.1 from
http://www.reduz.com.ar/rx_saturno/rx-saturno-0.0.1.tar.gz

Unpack the tarball, configure and make rx_saturno.

Now change to the "lib" directory inside the rx-saturno-0.0.1 source.

Unpack the rx7~.tar.gz attached to this mail. It will create a directory called
"pd" in "lib". 

Change directory again, this time to "pd" and run the little shell script
"./build-ext"

Now all's done.
